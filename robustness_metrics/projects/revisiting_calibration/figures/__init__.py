"""Figures for 'Revisiting Calibration of Modern Neural Networks'.

Each figure is defined as a separate Python file in the "figures" directory. The
file should define a "plot" function which generates the main figure. It may
also define functions for additional plot variants and helper functions.

New figure files should be imported here and added to __all__ to allow for
easy importing and automatic testing.
