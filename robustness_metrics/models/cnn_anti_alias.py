"""Anti aliased CNNs.

For more information on the models please refer to

  https://github.com/adobe/antialiased-cnns

You need `antialiased-cnns` to be on sys.path before loading this module.
Note that the model will be downloaded on the first run.

The model scores 77.2% accuracy on ImageNet and 65.0% on ImageNet-V2.
